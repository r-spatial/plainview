Description: Provides methods for plotting potentially large (raster) images
    interactively on a plain HTML canvas. 
    Supports plotting of RasterLayer, RasterStack, RasterBrick
    (from package raster) as well as png files located on disk. Interactivity
    includes zooming, panning, and mouse location information. In case of 
    multi-layer RasterStacks or RasterBricks, RBG image plots are created 
    (similar to raster::plotRGB - but interactive).
